# Memory Game Project - FEND

##### Karl Watson





This project created app.js logic for the game _Concentration_



##### Goals

* Game must track time, assign a star rating, and track number of moves

* Cards that don't match briefly display before flipping back over

* Cards that match stay visible

* When game is completed, modal displays stats and closing restarts game

* Restart button also restarts game

* Game timer starts on the first card click not on page load

* Site must be responsive and scale to different viewport sizes
